# purpose: function to compute C index for cox model by inputting new data based 
#          on the values of the variables and the time and status of the subjects

cindex <- function(betas, new_x, new_y){
  
  # dats <data frame or tibble>: contains x, time and status for all subjects/ patients
  # varss <vector>: names (char vector) or positions (numeric vector) within dats of t
  # betas <data frame or tibble>: values of the estimated betas to be tested
  #   IMPORTANT: the data frame of tibble must have two columns named x and coefs,
  #              x with the names of the variables and coefs with the estimated betas
  # new_x <data frame or tibble or matrix>: values of the variables corresponding to betas that will be used to compute the c-index 
  # new_y <Surv object from survival library>: Surv object with the times and status of the observations  that will be used to compute the c-index
  #   IMPORTANT: new_x and new_y must have the same order so row 1 of new_x and row 1 of new_y correspond
  #              to the exact same individual and so on
  
  # transpose the new data to fit in tidydata
